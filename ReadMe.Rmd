## Modelling stable isotope composition of plant tissue (oxygen and hydrogen)

#### *Note*
This package still is under development

## Description

`isoplants` is a lightweight R package to model the isotopic ratios in in plant tissue and analyze the sensitivity to changes in environmental conditions. It currently focuses on stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes but will likely also integrate carbon isotopes in future  releases.
It uses the R package [tealeaves](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tealeaves) to integrate the calculation of leaf temperatures.

## Get isoplants

From GitHub

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dabasler/isoplants")
```

And load isoplants

```r
library("isoplants")
```
